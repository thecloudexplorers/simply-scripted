# Comprehensive Guide to PowerShell Scripting Best Practices

## Introduction
This document serves as a guide to best practices and style guidelines for writing PowerShell scripts. Drawing on the philosophy and structure presented in the unofficial "PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide" from PoshCode, as well as specific guidance from the official Microsoft PowerShell documentation, this guide aims to help scripters write code that is more reusable, readable, and maintainable. By following these practices, you can avoid common problems and facilitate collaboration within the PowerShell community.

The "PowerShell Best Practices" described in the sources are intended as starting points â€“ ways of writing, thinking, and designing code that make it harder to get into trouble. The ultimate goal is to help you "fall into the pit of success" where winning practices are the easiest path. While these are referred to as practices and guidelines, not rigid rules, and exceptions exist, they provide a baseline for code structure, design, programming, formatting, and style. Pragmatism is encouraged; if a guideline is hindering progress, it might be appropriate to deviate, but this document provides the recommended approach.

Remember that the PowerShell language, tools, and community understanding are constantly evolving, and these practices are likewise subject to evolution and updates.

## Categories of Best Practices

### General Philosophy and Approach

1. **Best Practice Title**: Aim for the "Pit of Success"  
   **Description**: Design and write your PowerShell code in such a way that it is harder for users (including your future self) to encounter problems. The structure, formatting, and design should naturally lead to correct and effective usage.  
   **Rationale**: To make winning practices easy to fall into by using the platform and frameworks effectively. Making it easy to get into trouble represents a failure in design.

2. **Best Practice Title**: Prioritize Reusability and Readability  
   **Description**: Focus on writing code that doesn't need to be rewritten frequently (reusable) and code that can be easily understood and maintained by others (readable).  
   **Rationale**: Reusable code saves time and effort by avoiding duplication, while readable code ensures that maintenance, updates, and collaboration are straightforward.

3. **Best Practice Title**: Be Pragmatic, Not Dogmatic  
   **Description**: Treat these practices and guidelines as helpful recommendations rather than strict, unbreakable rules. If adhering strictly to a guideline is causing significant difficulty in accomplishing a task, it may be appropriate to deviate.  
   **Rationale**: The purpose of the guidelines is to help achieve success efficiently. They are tools to assist development, not barriers.

### Naming Conventions

4. **Best Practice Title**: Use Specific, Singular Nouns for Commands (Functions/Cmdlets)  
   **Description**: When naming your functions (analogous to cmdlet nouns), use nouns that are very specific. Prefix generic nouns with a shortened product or module name if applicable (e.g., "SQLServer" instead of just "Server"). The noun should be singular, even if the command is expected to act upon multiple items (e.g., Get-Process instead of Get-Processes).  
   **Rationale**: Specific nouns, combined with approved verbs, enhance discoverability and help users anticipate functionality, avoiding name duplication. Singular nouns provide a consistent convention across commands.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Naming Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#use-a-specific-noun-for-a-cmdlet-name-sd01)

5. **Best Practice Title**: Use Pascal Case for Command and Parameter Names  
   **Description**: Capitalize the first letter of the verb and all terms used in the noun for command names (e.g., Clear-ItemProperty). Similarly, capitalize the first letter of each word in parameter names (e.g., ErrorAction).  
   **Rationale**: Pascal casing provides a standard, readable format for command and parameter names, contributing to overall code readability and consistency with built-in PowerShell commands.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Naming Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#use-pascal-case-for-cmdlet-names-sd02)

6. **Best Practice Title**: Use Standard Parameter Names  
   **Description**: Where possible, use standard parameter names for common concepts to align with other PowerShell commands. If a more specific name is needed, consider using the standard name and providing the more specific name as an alias.  
   **Rationale**: Using standard names helps users quickly understand the parameter's purpose based on their experience with other PowerShell commands.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Naming Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#use-standard-parameter-names)

7. **Best Practice Title**: Use Singular Parameter Names  
   **Description**: Avoid plural names for parameters whose value represents a single element, even if that value can be an array or list. Plural names should be reserved for parameters whose value is always a multiple-element collection.  
   **Rationale**: This guideline ensures consistency in parameter naming across different commands.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Naming Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#use-singular-parameter-names)

### Code Structure and Formatting

8. **Best Practice Title**: Follow Consistent Code Layout and Formatting  
   **Description**: Organize your code logically and apply consistent formatting styles throughout scripts and functions. This includes indentation, spacing, and line breaks.  
   **Rationale**: Consistent formatting significantly improves code readability and makes it easier to understand the structure and flow.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Style Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle#style-guide-introduction)

9. **Best Practice Title**: Avoid Line Continuation Characters in Code Examples  
   **Description**: In documentation or examples, avoid using the backtick (`) line continuation character.  
   **Rationale**: Backtick characters are difficult to see and can introduce errors if extra spaces follow them on a line. Using alternatives like splatting or natural line breaks improves robustness and readability.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#avoid-line-continuation-in-code-samples)

10. **Best Practice Title**: Use Natural Line Breaks or Splatting  
   **Description**: Instead of using the line continuation backtick, take advantage of PowerShell's ability to break lines naturally after pipe (|), opening braces ({), parentheses ((), and brackets ([) characters. For cmdlets or functions with many parameters, use splatting to improve readability.  
   **Rationale**: This makes code easier to read and reduces the risk of errors associated with line continuation characters.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#avoid-line-continuation-in-code-samples)

11. **Best Practice Title**: Avoid PowerShell Prompts in Examples (Where Applicable)  
   **Description**: When providing code examples, avoid including the PowerShell prompt string (PS>  or similar) unless specifically demonstrating command-line usage or when the displayed path is essential. Use PS> as a simplified prompt if one is necessary.  
   **Rationale**: Omitting the prompt makes code examples cleaner and easier for users to copy and paste.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#avoid-using-powershell-prompts-in-examples)

12. **Best Practice Title**: Avoid Aliases in Examples  
   **Description**: Unless the purpose of an example is to demonstrate an alias, use the full name of cmdlets and parameters. Ensure names are in Pascal case.  
   **Rationale**: Using full names makes examples clearer and more understandable, especially for users unfamiliar with common aliases.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#dont-use-aliases-in-examples)

13. **Best Practice Title**: Avoid Positional Parameters in Examples  
   **Description**: To prevent confusion, include the parameter name in code examples, even if the parameter could be used positionally.  
   **Rationale**: Explicitly naming parameters makes the purpose of values in an example immediately clear.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#using-parameters-in-examples)

14. **Best Practice Title**: Use Backticks for Inline Code Elements in Text  
   **Description**: When referring to code elements like variable names ($files), cmdlet names (Get-ChildItem), parameter names used in syntax (-Name), method names (ToString()), or paths (C:\Windows) within descriptive text, format them using single backticks (`).  
   **Rationale**: This clearly distinguishes code elements from surrounding prose, improving readability.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#formatting-command-syntax-elements)

15. **Best Practice Title**: Use Fenced Code Blocks for Multi-Line Code  
   **Description**: For code examples spanning multiple lines, use triple backticks (```) to create fenced code blocks. Include a language label like powershell after the opening fence for syntax highlighting. Output from commands should be placed in a separate fenced block with the `Output` label.  
   **Rationale**: Fenced code blocks are standard Markdown for multi-line code, enabling syntax highlighting and providing features like a copy button in many renderers. Using a separate `Output` block prevents syntax highlighting on command output.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#markdown-for-code-samples)

16. **Best Practice Title**: Write Single Records to the Output Pipeline  
   **Description**: When your script or function generates objects as output, write them to the pipeline immediately as they are produced, rather than collecting them all in memory and outputting a large array at the end. Use the Write-Output cmdlet (or implicitly by placing the object on a line). For advanced functions or cmdlets, this corresponds to using the WriteObject() method.  
   **Rationale**: Writing objects one by one allows commands further down the pipeline to begin processing data without waiting for the entire output to be generated, improving responsiveness and reducing memory usage.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#write-single-records-to-the-pipeline-sc03)

### Documentation and Help

17. **Best Practice Title**: Include Documentation and Comments  
   **Description**: Add comments within your code to explain complex logic or non-obvious sections. For functions and scripts intended for reuse, include comment-based help or separate help files (like about_ topics or XML help).  
   **Rationale**: Documentation and comments make your code easier for others (and your future self) to understand, maintain, and use. Clear help enables users to discover how to use your functions correctly.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Style Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle#style-guide-introduction), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#create-a-cmdlet-help-file-sd05)

18. **Best Practice Title**: Follow Formatting Guidelines for Help/Documentation Files  
   **Description**: If creating documentation files (like about_ topics or help files for modules), adhere to established formatting guidelines, such as line length limits for paragraphs and code blocks, and proper handling of special characters.  
   **Rationale**: Consistent formatting ensures documentation is readable and renders correctly across different tools and versions of PowerShell.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Documentation Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/powershell-docs-style-guide?view=powershell-7.4#formatting-about_-files)

### Readability

19. **Best Practice Title**: Write Code That is Easy to Read  
   **Description**: Actively strive to make your code understandable upon first reading. This involves applying consistent formatting, using clear and descriptive names, and structuring your code logically.  
   **Rationale**: Readable code is essential for maintainability, collaboration, and reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs.

### Writing Reusable Code / Tooling

20. **Best Practice Title**: Build Functions and Modules for Reusability  
   **Description**: Encapsulate related logic into functions and organize functions into modules.  
   **Rationale**: Functions and modules allow code to be reused across different scripts and projects without copying and pasting, making updates easier and ensuring consistency.  
   [Read More: PoshCode Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle#best-practices-introduction), [Read More: PoshCode Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle#what-are-best-practices)

21. **Best Practice Title**: Design Functions to Operate in a Pipeline  
   **Description**: When writing functions that process or produce data, design them to work effectively in the middle of a pipeline, accepting input from previous commands and providing output for subsequent commands. Use param() blocks with appropriate attributes (e.g., ValueFromPipeline, ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName) and process {} blocks to handle pipeline input item by item. (Adapted from Cmdlet guidelines).  
   **Rationale**: Supporting pipeline input makes your functions composable, allowing users to chain commands together easily and leveraging the power of the pipeline.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#implement-for-the-middle-of-a-pipeline-sc02), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-input-from-the-pipeline), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-the-processrecord-method)

22. **Best Practice Title**: Make Commands Case-Insensitive but Case-Preserving  
   **Description**: Design your commands (functions/scripts) to operate in a case-insensitive manner when processing input (e.g., string comparisons) but preserve the original case of input values for any output or downstream processing.  
   **Rationale**: PowerShell is inherently case-insensitive by default for many operations, but preserving case maintains compatibility and aligns with how PowerShell interacts with underlying systems.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#make-cmdlets-case-insensitive-and-case-preserving-sc04)

23. **Best Practice Title**: Use Standard Types for Parameters  
   **Description**: Define function parameters using specific .NET Framework types or standard PowerShell types wherever possible. Avoid using generic string parameters unless the value is genuinely free-form text. For parameters accepting values from a set of options, use enumeration types or the [ValidateSet()] attribute. For boolean parameters, use [Switch] or [Nullable[bool]].  
   **Rationale**: Using specific types provides better parameter validation, makes the function's expectations clear, and improves consistency with other PowerShell commands.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#use-standard-types-for-parameters), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#use-strongly-typed-net-framework-types), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#parameters-that-take-a-list-of-options), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#parameters-that-take-true-and-false)

24. **Best Practice Title**: Support Arrays for Parameters  
   **Description**: For parameters that identify items to operate on, design them to accept arrays of values so users can easily process multiple items with a single command.  
   **Rationale**: This simplifies scripting for users who need to perform the same operation on multiple inputs.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-arrays-for-parameters)

25. **Best Practice Title**: Support the PassThru Parameter for State-Changing Commands  
   **Description**: If your command modifies system state and doesn't return an object by default (acting as a "sink"), include a [Switch] parameter named PassThru. When -PassThru is specified, output the modified object to the pipeline (e.g., using Write-Output or WriteObject()). This is particularly relevant for commands performing 'Add', 'Set', or 'New' operations.  
   **Rationale**: The PassThru parameter allows users to easily retrieve the object that was just modified, enabling further processing in the pipeline.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-the-passthru-parameter)

26. **Best Practice Title**: Use Parameter Sets for Mutually Exclusive Parameter Groups  
   **Description**: If your function or script needs to accomplish a single purpose but there are distinct, mutually exclusive ways to specify the target or operation using different groups of parameters, use parameter sets. (Relevant for advanced functions).  
   **Rationale**: Parameter sets clarify which parameters can be used together and simplify the user interface for commands with complex options.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-parameter-sets)

27. **Best Practice Title**: Support Windows PowerShell Paths and Wildcards  
   **Description**: If your command works with file system locations or items in other PowerShell providers, include parameters that accept PowerShell paths. Standard parameter names are Path (supporting wildcards) and LiteralPath (for paths containing wildcard characters literally). Use provider-aware methods to resolve paths. Support wildcard characters in appropriate parameters where users might need to specify multiple items using patterns.  
   **Rationale**: Supporting standard path parameters and wildcards aligns with user expectations and allows your command to interact seamlessly with PowerShell providers.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-windows-powershell-paths), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-wildcard-characters)

### Error Handling and Feedback

28. **Best Practice Title**: Implement Robust Error Handling  
   **Description**: Anticipate potential errors in your script and implement mechanisms to handle them gracefully. Use try/catch/finally blocks and consider using parameter validation attributes.  
   **Rationale**: Proper error handling prevents scripts from crashing unexpectedly and provides useful information to the user when something goes wrong.  
   [Read More: PoshCode Best Practices Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle#best-practices-introduction)

29. **Best Practice Title**: Provide Feedback to the User Using Standard Streams  
   **Description**: Use the Write-Warning, Write-Verbose, and Write-Debug cmdlets (or their corresponding methods in advanced functions) to provide different levels of feedback.  
   â—¦ Write-Warning: For operations that might have unintended consequences.  
   â—¦ Write-Verbose: For detailed information about what the script is doing, useful for understanding execution flow.  
   â—¦ Write-Debug: For information useful for troubleshooting by developers or support.  
   **Rationale**: Using these standard streams allows users to control the verbosity of output via preference variables ($WarningPreference, $VerbosePreference, $DebugPreference), tailoring the feedback to their needs.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#provide-feedback-to-the-user-sd04), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-the-writewarning-writeverbose-and-writedebug-methods)

30. **Best Practice Title**: Report Progress for Long-Running Operations  
   **Description**: For script sections or functions that take a significant amount of time to complete and cannot run in the background, include progress reporting using the Write-Progress cmdlet (or WriteProgress() method).  
   **Rationale**: Progress reporting keeps the user informed about the status of the operation, especially during lengthy tasks, improving the user experience.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-writeprogress-for-operations-that-take-a-long-time)

31. **Best Practice Title**: Use Host Interfaces for Direct User Interaction  
   **Description**: If your script or function requires direct interaction with the user (e.g., prompting for a choice or reading a line of input) beyond standard output/feedback streams, use the $Host variable's methods. Avoid using System.Console methods directly.  
   **Rationale**: The $Host interface provides a standardized way for commands to interact with different PowerShell host applications (console, ISE, graphical hosts), ensuring compatibility. Using System.Console bypasses the host and may not work in all environments.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#use-the-host-interfaces)

### Pipeline Support

32. **Best Practice Title**: Design Commands to Accept Pipeline Input  
   **Description**: For functions intended to process data from other commands, include parameters configured to accept pipeline input using ValueFromPipeline or ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName attributes in the param() block. Process this input within a process {} block. (Adapted from Cmdlet guidelines).  
   **Rationale**: This enables your functions to participate seamlessly in the PowerShell pipeline, making them more flexible and powerful for users.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-input-from-the-pipeline), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-the-processrecord-method)

### Parameters and Input

33. **Best Practice Title**: Define Parameters Clearly  
   **Description**: Use a param() block at the beginning of your script or function to define parameters. Use appropriate parameter attributes to control behavior like validation, mandatory status, and pipeline input. (Adapted from Cmdlet guidelines).  
   **Rationale**: Explicitly defined parameters make the script/function's required and optional inputs clear, enable validation, and allow for robust pipeline support.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#coding-parameters-sc01), [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#support-input-from-the-pipeline)

### Working with Objects

34. **Best Practice Title**: Standardize Output Objects for Pipeline Use  
   **Description**: If your module defines custom object types, design them so that their members map logically to parameters of commands that might consume them in a pipeline. Consider extending existing .NET types with custom properties or aliases using Types.ps1xml files to improve their usability and consistency in PowerShell.  
   **Rationale**: Well-designed output objects simplify pipeline scenarios and make your tools work more harmoniously with other PowerShell commands. Standardizing existing types improves the overall consistency of working with objects in PowerShell.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#defining-objects)

35. **Best Practice Title**: Implement IComparable on Custom Output Objects  
   **Description**: For custom objects that you output, implement the System.IComparable interface. (Relevant for module development defining custom objects).  
   **Rationale**: Implementing IComparable allows users to easily sort your custom objects using commands like Sort-Object.  
   [Read More: PowerShell Cmdlet Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/strongly-encouraged-development-guidelines?view=powershell-7.4#implement-the-icomparable-interface)

36. **Best Practice Title**: Customize Object Display if Needed  
   **Description**: If the default display of your custom output objects is not user-friendly, create a custom .Format.ps1xml file to define tailored views.  
   **Rationale**: Customized formatting improves the usability and readability of the output from your commands.
