    .SYNOPSIS
    Performs an assessment of Azure DevOps organization-level policies.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function queries the internal Azure DevOps organization policy endpoint
    and displays effective values for important governance, security, and privacy-related settings.

    .PARAMETER Organization
    The name of your Azure DevOps organization (e.g. 'contoso').

    .PARAMETER AccessToken
    A valid Azure DevOps Bearer token with access to read organization-level settings.

    .EXAMPLE
    Invoke-AdoOrgPolicyAssessment -Organization "demojev" -AccessToken $token

    .NOTES
    WARNING: This function uses an internal and undocumented API endpoint:
             https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_settings/organizationPolicy?__rt=fps&__ver=2

             This endpoint is not part of the officially supported Azure DevOps REST API.
             Microsoft may change, deprecate, or remove it at any time without notice.
             Use in production scenarios at your own risk and validate regularly.
